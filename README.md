# 👋 Welcome!

I am Akbarjon Rozimov

---

I am an evolutionary biologist specializing in the integration of **molecular genomics**, **morphometrics**, and **ecological data** to investigate the mechanisms of **speciation**, **population divergence**, and **adaptation** in freshwater fishes.

🎓 Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the **Fish Evolution and Genomics Group**,  
**Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, Beijing, China.

## 🧬 Research Interests

- Conservation genomics of endangered fishes  
- Systematics and phylogeography of Central Asian ichthyofauna  
- Genomic basis of morphological variation  
- Hybridization and speciation in riverine systems  
- Integrative approaches combining genomics, morphology, and ecology  

---

## 🌍 Regional Focus

My research focuses on the **freshwater biodiversity of Central Asia**, with a particular emphasis on **threatened and endemic taxa** of the **Amu Darya** and **Syr Darya** river basins.

## 🔬 Methodologies

- Morphometric analysis and geometric morphometrics
- Length-weight relationships
- Mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation
- Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
- De novo genome assembly  
- SNP genotyping and population structure analysis  
- Phylogenomic inference and demographic modeling
- Inbreeding, Genetic Load  

---

## 🎯 Research Goal

Through the application of **high-throughput sequencing**, **comparative genomics**, and **population genetic modeling**, I aim to generate data-driven insights that inform **biodiversity conservation** and **evolutionary theory**, particularly in **ecologically fragile and understudied regions** of Central Asia.
