I am an evolutionary biologist specializing in the integration of **morphometrics**, **molecular genomics**, and **ecological data** to investigate the mechanisms of **speciation**, **population divergence**, and **adaptation** in freshwater fishes.

🎓 Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the  
**Fish Evolution and Genomics Group**,  
**State Key Laboratory of Animal Biodiversity Conservation and Integrated Pest Management**,  
**Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, **Beijing, China**.

## 🧬 Research Interests

- **Taxonomy, systematics, and species delimitation** of freshwater fishes using integrative approaches  
- **Phylogeography and historical biogeography** of Central Asian ichthyofauna  
- **Hybridization, introgression, and reproductive isolation** in fragmented riverine ecosystems  
- **Morphological evolution and phenotypic plasticity** under natural and anthropogenic influences  
- **Genome assembly and comparative genomics** of non-model and endangered taxa  
- **Phylogenomics** to resolve evolutionary relationships at multiple taxonomic scales  
- **Population genomics and demographic reconstruction** to infer historical changes in population size and structure  
- **Inbreeding, genetic load, and purging** in small and declining populations  
- **Conservation genomics** for biodiversity assessment and prioritization in data-deficient regions  
- **Integrative evolutionary research** combining morphology, ecology, and genomics to understand biodiversity patterns

---

## 🌍 Regional Focus

My research is centered on the **freshwater biodiversity of Central Asia**, particularly the **Amu Darya** and **Syr Darya** river basins. These systems represent evolutionary laboratories shaped by complex geological and climatic histories and are home to many **threatened and endemic fish species**.

## 🔬 Methodologies

- Morphometric and geometric morphometric analysis  
- Length–weight relationships and condition factor assessment  
- Mitochondrial and nuclear genome assembly and annotation  
- Genome-wide analysis of genetic structure and diversity  
- Demographic modeling based on allele frequency spectra  
- Phylogenetic and phylogenomic inference  
- Hybridization analysis and introgression testing  
- Assessment of genomic inbreeding and mutational load  
- Statistical analysis and data visualization integrating ecological, morphological, and genetic datasets

---

## 🎯 Research Goal

My overarching goal is to produce robust, multidimensional datasets that contribute to both **evolutionary biology** and **applied conservation**. By integrating morphology, genomics, and ecology, I aim to provide a deeper understanding of biodiversity dynamics in **ecologically fragile** and **understudied regions** such as Central Asia.
